Implementation roadmap specifically for the IT Department focusing on infrastructure, security, and integration.

## Overview

The IT Department plays a critical role in the EBT Instructor implementation, responsible for infrastructure deployment, security configuration, and system integration.

## Focus Areas

### Infrastructure
- Cloud infrastructure setup and configuration
- Server deployment and scaling
- Network configuration and security
- Database setup and management
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Security
- Authentication setup (Azure AD/SSO)
- Authorization and access control
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
- Security policies and compliance
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Integration
- System integrations with existing IT infrastructure
- API configuration and management
- Data synchronization setup
- Third-party service integrations
- Backup and disaster recovery integration
