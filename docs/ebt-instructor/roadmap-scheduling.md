# Scheduling Department

Implementation roadmap specifically for the Scheduling Department focusing on training scheduling integration.

## Overview

The Scheduling Department manages training schedules, resource allocation, and calendar coordination for EBT Instructor implementation.

## Focus Areas

### Training Scheduling
- Training session scheduling
- Resource allocation
- Calendar management
- Conflict resolution
- Schedule optimization

### Integration
- Integration with scheduling systems
- Calendar synchronization
- Resource management integration
- Notification systems
- Reporting and analytics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Schedule Configuration (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Review scheduling requirements
- [ ] Configure training calendars
- [ ] Set up resource types
- [ ] Define scheduling rules
- [ ] Plan integration points

### Phase 2: System Setup (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Configure scheduling workflows
- [ ] Set up availability windows
- [ ] Configure resource allocation
- [ ] Set up notification systems
- [ ] Test scheduling rules

### Phase 3: Integration Setup (Week 3-5)
- [ ] Integrate with scheduling systems
- [ ] Set up calendar synchronization
- [ ] Configure resource management
- [ ] Connect notification systems

- [ ] Validate calendar synchronization
- [ ] Test conflict resolution
- [ ] Review scheduling reports
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Training and Deployment (Week 6-7)
- [ ] Train scheduling staff
- [ ] Conduct pilot scheduling
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Refine scheduling processes
- [ ] Prepare for full deployment

### Phase 6: Operations (Week 7+)
- [ ] Monitor scheduling processes
- [ ] Optimize resource utilization
- [ ] Refine scheduling rules
