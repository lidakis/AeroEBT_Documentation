## 1. Data Controller and Data Processor Information

### 1.1 SkyDynamics as Data Processor

**For Client Data and organizational user data, SkyDynamics operates as a DATA PROCESSOR, not a data controller.** The client organization (airline, flight training organization, or other entity that has deployed the App) is the DATA CONTROLLER responsible for:

- Determining the purposes and means of processing personal data
- Obtaining all necessary consents from data subjects (their employees, trainees, instructors)
- Providing privacy notices to their end users
- Responding to data subject requests (access, deletion, portability)
- Ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws
- **All regulatory compliance and any associated fines or penalties**

**SkyDynamics, as a data processor, merely processes data on behalf of and under the instructions of the client organization. SkyDynamics assumes zero (€0) liability for client organizations' data protection compliance.**

### 1.2 SkyDynamics as Data Controller

For limited administrative purposes (such as account management for direct SkyDynamics customers not affiliated with a client organization), SkyDynamics may act as a data controller. In such cases:

**SkyDynamics**  
Email: [ebt@skydynamics.aero](mailto:ebt@skydynamics.aero)  
Support Portal: [https://skydynamics.youtrack.cloud](https://skydynamics.youtrack.cloud/form/ab66a348-a8b9-4de9-a7c3-c51b25c940b0)  
Documentation: [https://aeroebtdocs.skydynamics.aero](https://aeroebtdocs.skydynamics.aero)

### 1.3 Client Organization Responsibility

**If you are using the App through your employer or organization, your organization is the data controller for your personal data. You should direct all privacy inquiries and data subject requests to your organization, not to SkyDynamics. SkyDynamics assumes zero (€0) liability for your organization's data protection practices.**

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at the email above. However, for data subject requests, please contact your organization's data protection officer or privacy contact.

**SKYDYNAMICS, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS ASSUME ABSOLUTELY NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO:**

THIS COMPLETE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF SKYDYNAMICS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**

### 21.3 Maximum Liability Cap

**IN NO EVENT SHALL SKYDYNAMICS' TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DATA PROCESSING, OR THE APP EXCEED ZERO EUROS (€0). SKYDYNAMICS ASSUMES NO FINANCIAL LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE APP, DATA PROCESSING, OR THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

You expressly acknowledge and agree that SkyDynamics provides the App and data processing services without assuming any financial liability, and that this zero-liability provision is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between SkyDynamics and users. This limitation shall apply even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.

### 21.4 Jurisdictional Limitations

Some jurisdictions do not allow the complete exclusion of liability. **In such jurisdictions, SkyDynamics' liability shall be excluded and limited to the absolute minimum extent permitted by applicable law, which in all cases shall be zero (€0) or the lowest amount legally permissible.** You expressly waive any and all claims against SkyDynamics to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any liability that cannot be legally excluded shall be limited to the re-performance of services, at SkyDynamics' sole discretion, and under no circumstances shall include monetary compensation.

### 21.5 Specific Liability Exclusions and Limitations

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:**

**(a) FRAUD AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT:** You acknowledge that SkyDynamics operates in good faith and that any claims of fraud or intentional misconduct must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Any such claims shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Athens, Greece, and you waive any right to bring such claims in any other jurisdiction. You agree that any damages for fraud or intentional misconduct, if proven, shall be limited to direct damages actually suffered and documented, excluding all consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages. **You further agree to indemnify SkyDynamics for all costs and legal fees if any claim of fraud or intentional misconduct is not proven.**

**(b) GROSS NEGLIGENCE:** You acknowledge that SkyDynamics exercises reasonable care in providing its services. Any claim of gross negligence must demonstrate a conscious and voluntary disregard of the need for care, which in light of the facts, creates a substantial risk of serious harm. You agree that any liability for gross negligence, to the extent it cannot be excluded, shall be limited to direct damages actually suffered and shall exclude all consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages. **You further agree to indemnify SkyDynamics for all costs if any claim of gross negligence is not proven.**

- Any use of the App during actual flight operations is STRICTLY PROHIBITED and constitutes a breach of these terms
- Any death or personal injury arising from misuse of the App (including use during flight operations) is the sole responsibility of the user and/or their organization
- **SkyDynamics assumes zero (€0) liability for any death or personal injury, as such outcomes cannot result from proper use of a ground-based training software application**
- **Any claim of death or personal injury would necessarily arise from user misuse, for which the user and their organization bear sole liability and agree to indemnify SkyDynamics**

**(d) REGULATORY FINES AND GDPR:** You acknowledge and agree that:
- **SkyDynamics operates as a DATA PROCESSOR, not a data controller, for Client Data** - the client organization is the data controller responsible for GDPR compliance for their end users
- Client organizations bear sole responsibility for their own GDPR compliance, including obtaining consents, providing privacy notices, and responding to data subject requests
- **Any GDPR fines or regulatory penalties arising from Client Data or client organization practices are the sole responsibility of the client organization**
- Client organizations agree to indemnify SkyDynamics for 100% of any regulatory fines, penalties, or enforcement costs arising from the client's data or practices
- To the extent SkyDynamics is considered a data controller for its own operations, SkyDynamics' liability for any GDPR fines shall be limited to the minimum extent permitted by law, and users/clients agree to indemnify SkyDynamics for any fines arising from user-provided data or user/client actions
